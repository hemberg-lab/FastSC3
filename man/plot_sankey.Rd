\title{Plot Sankey diagram comparing two clusterings}
\usage{
plot_sankey(reference, clusters, plot_width = 400, plot_height = 600,
  colors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{reference clustering labels}

\item{clusters}{clustering labels under investigations}

\item{plot_width}{width of the output plot in pixels}

\item{colors}{colors of the links between two clusterings. If defined please
note that each cluster in the reference clustering has to have its own color.
This should be a normal text vector, e.g. c("#FF0000", "#FFA500", "#008000")}
}
\description{
Sometimes it is useful to see how the clusters in two different clustering
solutions correspond to each other. Sankey diagram is a good way to visualize
them. This function takes as input two clustering solutions and visualizes them
using a Sankey diagram. The order of the reference clusters is defined by their
labels in increasing order.
