\title{Fast-Johnson-Lindenstrauss-Transform (FJLT)}
\usage{
fjlt(x, k = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{input expression matrix}

\item{k}{number of dimension to reduce to}
}
\value{
transformed reduced expression matrix
}
\description{
This function calculates the FJLT and project onto d dimensions. The FJLT 
is faster than standard random pro-jections and just as easy to implement. 
It is based upon the preconditioning of a sparse projection matrix with a 
randomized Fourier transform.
